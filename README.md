To view the project click on the  notebook.ipynb file. The other files are the database materials that were queried to get the results of the project.

This project uses 67 years of information from the LEGO Database.

The project reads in the colors comma separated value file, which represents one table of the database.
A DataFrame is made when the project is read in. The first 5 rows of the DataFrame are then printed to get an idea about
what information is in it.

The amount of colors in the DataFrame is then found out by finding the length of the colors 'id' column.

The amount of transparent versus non-transparent color information is then found.

The sets comma separated value file is read in.  The sets file holds information regarding the types of LEGO sets sold.
The average number of LEGO parts each year is  found and plotted.

The number of LEGO Themes shipped per year is then found.
